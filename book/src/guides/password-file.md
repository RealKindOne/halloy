# Storing passwords in a File

If you need to commit your configuration file to a public repository, you can keep your passwords in a separate file for security. Below is an example of using a file for nickname password for NICKSERV.


> ðŸ’¡ Avoid adding extra lines in the password file, as they will be treated as part of the password.

> ðŸ’¡ Shell expansions (e.g. `"~/"` â†’ `"/home/user/"`) are not supported in path strings.

```toml
[servers.liberachat]
nickname = "foobar"
nick_password_file = "/home/user/config/halloy/password"
server = "irc.libera.chat"
channels = ["#halloy"]
```
